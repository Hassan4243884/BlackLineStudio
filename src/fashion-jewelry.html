                <h2>Fashion Jewelry</h2>

                <p>Jewellery has long been used for body adornment—dating back to the days before written history even began. While we no longer use the scraps of fabric and carved animal bones which once decorated the necks and wrists of early man, we haven’t gotten away from the practice of adding a little gleam and glam to our daily ensembles through the use of styled jewellery.</p>

                <p>Jewellery is a personalized accessory. Not everyone likes the same styles.
                    Not everyone enjoys the same materials or colours. Realizing this, Black Line Studio wanted to offer the best of the best in a wide array of styles, brands,
                    and looks.</p>

                <p>As we wanted to ensure there was something for everyone, Toronto’s number one tattoo, piercing, and removal studio is now offering several exciting brands of high-end jewellery.</p>
