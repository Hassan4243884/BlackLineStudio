 content: 'The laser is highly attracted to the carbon substance. When it passes along the treatment area, it exfoliates while removing dead skin cells and blackheads. The result is smoother, glowing skin with reduced pore size and an improved,
           even skin tone.'

 content: 'The heat omitted by the laser during the carbon peel reduces the bacteria responsible for acne, allowing for improved control of pimples and outbreaks. The heat also shrinks the sebaceous glands, reducing oil production and congestion
           in the pores.'
