                <p>People change, and as they do “tattoo regret” can take over. Tattoo regret can happen over all kinds of tattoos. Maybe it’s the name of an ex or even just a poorly done tattoo, either way, this problem does have an awesome fix. Cover-ups!</p>

                <p>Cover-ups are a fantastically creative way to breathe new life into old tattoos. Some people opt to simply remold an old design into a more updated/better version of the piece, while others prefer to completely
                    block out any evidence of the old tattoo. If the regret is strong, people usually go with the second option. Of the two, it can also be the more challenging, which is why it’s advisable to go to an artist that you know
                    has significant skill in this area. Blackline Studio are experts at Tattoo Cover-Ups and Tattoo Removal!</p>
