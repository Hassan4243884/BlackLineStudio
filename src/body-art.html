                <p>Body art has been around for centuries as form of art and expression. From cultural events, parades, costume events, and music festivals to even supporting sports teams, protests or advertising â€“ there are plenty of excuses to transform the human body into a work of art.</p>
                <p>Using airbrushing, stencils or brush-work, Blackline Studio has highly experienced artists who specialize in the creation of unique designs and body art. They can replicate almost any design or logo, or create a completely customized piece for you.</p>
                <p>Black Line Studio uses Paasche water-based body art airbrush paints to achieve any look. Just like temporary tattoos, the paint can last up to 5 days if desired, however, the paint can also be removed as soon as you like with exfoliation. Our Carbon Peel facial is a great way to get a thorough clean and remove any excess paint on the face and in your pores.</p>
                <p>For more information on body art and body painting, contact Blackline Studio and speak to one of our artists today.</p>
