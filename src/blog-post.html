                            It could be an ex-partner’s name or something that no longer makes you happy.</p>

                        <p>Discover what seven questions are the most important to ask when getting rid of your body art </p>

                        <h3>The Price Isn’t Always Right, So Check First</h3>

                        <p>Individuals who perform laser tattoo removal don’t charge the same price across the board.
                            Price varies based on factors such as:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>How big the tattoo is</li>
                            <li>Location of the doctor doing the work</li>
                            <li>Number of years of experience</li>
                            <li>If the tattoo is in a difficult area to work on</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>If you only have a certain dollar amount to work with, make sure you talk to a few artists
                            who have skills related to tattoo removal.</p>

                        <p>Try to gage prices, and keep in mind depending on the work needed, there might not be
                            much wiggle room.</p>

                        <h3>Testimonials First: Learning about Others’ Experiences</h3>

                        <p>After pricing, it’s important to seek an artist who can provide you with the credibility of their skills. Before you commit to any individual, get testimonials or references from individuals who’ve had work done with this person.</p>

                        <p>Find out the answers to questions such as:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Did you feel comfortable</li>
                            <li>Was this person honest with you</li>
                            <li>Were they skilled/how much experience do they have</li>
                            <li>Would you suggest them to anyone else</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Talking with others who have gone through the process helps since you can find out what to
                            expect. It gives you an idea of how to approach the artist, and what you can expect for tattoo removal procedures.</p>

                        <h3>The Amount of Sessions Varies Based on Type of Laser Tattoo Removal</h3>

                        <p>It’s nice to get something done in one sitting and not have to deal with it anymore. Tattoos are not always one of those things that can be accomplished in one or even two sessions.</p>

                        <p>When it comes to what most folks wish they knew before getting tattoo removal, understanding how many sessions are required was one of them. The average amount of sessions are between six and ten for a tattoo getting fully removed.</p>

                        <p>Make sure you understand how many sessions you’ll need and how much each one costs before you commit to anything. You’ll avoid unwanted surprises and have a realistic expectation of what’s going to happen during your sessions.</p>
