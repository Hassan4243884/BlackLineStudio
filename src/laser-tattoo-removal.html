                    <p>Tattooing is an age-old practice dating back over 5,000 years, so it is no surprise that it is a popular activity in our modern society. In fact, recent studies show that over 38% of Canadians currently wear some form of ink on their bodies. With a percentage in the double digits, you’re bound to find some individuals who regret their tattoo for various reasons. This is where laser tattoo removal in Toronto comes into play.</p>

                    <p>Laser tattoo removal is the process of removing the appearance of your ink using a highly concentrated laser. This powerful, yet gentle laser, produces short pulses of light which targets the tattoo pigment, thus reducing any damage to the surrounding skin.</p>

                    <p>While it may seem as if the laser itself is removing the ink, the process is much more in-depth. The laser merely breaks up the ink into fragments which is then carried off by the body’s immune system. To prevent skin damage, the laser removal treatment is usually carried out over several sessions, lightening the ink’s visibility more with each service until all the particles have been removed.</p>

                    <p>As lasers use a light wavelength to disrupt the ink, some colours are more reactive than others. Black, for example, is the easiest colour to remove from the skin as it absorbs all wavelengths produced. Colours like blue and green are more difficult, often taking multiple additional sessions to fade or remove.</p>

                    <p>In addition to being used for removal services, lasers can be utilized in the process of covering or altering an existing tattoo. In this case, the laser is utilized to lighten a tattoo instead of merely removing it, prior to covering it with another piece.</p>
