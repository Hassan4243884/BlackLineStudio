                            <li>If the tattoo is oozing or if dried blood, ink or dead skin remains, re-wash

                <h2>Piercing Aftercare</h2>

                <p>Youâ€™ve just received a body piercing by a skilled and knowledgeable Black Line Studio professional who cleaned and disinfected the area pierced, and who used sterile instruments, jewelry and a single use needle.</p>

                <p><strong>Now it is up to you to take proper care of your piercing during the crucial healing period. How your piercing heals is up to you and your body.</strong></p>

                <p><strong>For optimal healing, it is important that:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>You take showers instead of baths and make sure that your piercing
                        is cleaned last to ensure the removal of any residue from soap
                        or other products.</li>
                    <li>When cleaning, remove any discharge or crust that collects
                        on and around the jewelry.</li>
                    <li>Do not cover your piercing with Band-Aids and/or ointment.</li>
                    <li>If you have any problems with your piercing, call Black Line Studio at <a href="tel:416-850-82-27">416-850-82-27</a>.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="cell medium-6 margin-bottom-3 text-center medium-order-2">
                <div class="image-bordered"><img src="" data-src="{{ site.app.url }}img/retail/piercing_aftercare.jpg" class="lozad" alt=""></div>
            </div>

            <div class="cell medium-6 margin-bottom-3 text-white wysiwyg medium-order-4">
                <h2>Oral Piercing</h2>

                <p>Swelling will normally occur during the first 3-7 days. During this time, it is important to drink plenty of cold liquids. Sucking on ice cubes can also help to reduce swelling. We recommend that you use <strong>H2OCEAN</strong> mouth wash which can be purchased at Black Line Studio. It is ideal that the piercing be cleaned after eating, smoking, or drinking anything other than water. Stay away from dairy products and beer for 4 weeks. Avoid kissing and oral sex which can spread bacteria.</p>

            <div class="cell medium-6 margin-bottom-3 text-white wysiwyg medium-order-5">
                <h2>Ears, Eyebrow, Septum, Nose, Nipple, Helix, and Navel:</h2>

                <p>We recommend using Trisan Anti-Bacterial Skin Cleanser, which can be purchased at Black Line Studio, to properly care for these types of piercings. Before cleansing the piercing, be sure to thoroughly wash your hands with soap. For most effective cleansing, apply the cleanser to a cotton swab and softly work it around both sides of the piercing. Afterwards, rinse the piercing thoroughly to ensure all of the Trisan, crust, and discharge has been removed. Apply H2OCEAN Sea Salt & Lysozyme Spray, 2-4 times daily. Spray the newly cleaned area, let sit for 5 minutes then hold a warm compress against the area for 5 minutes.</p>

                <p><strong>Be sure to avoid:</strong></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Alcohol, as it will dry out your piercing;</li>
                    <li>Swimming in chlorinated water;</li>
                    <li>Hydrogen Peroxide;</li>
                    <li>Oil-based ointments, such as Vaseline, Polysporin, Tea Tree Oil,
                        hand/body moisturizer;</li>
                    <li>Frequent contact with unwashed hands;</li>
                </ul>
