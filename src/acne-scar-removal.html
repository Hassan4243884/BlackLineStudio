                <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>

                <p>The procedure performed utilizing the Spectra laser is called a peel. During a peel, a client will undergo several passes of the Spectra laser, which omits quick pulses of intense light. These pulses of light target the melanin in the skin, breaking them up for the body’s natural processes to flush out. During the process, the laser heats up the skin, causing it to contract and stimulate the production of collagen.</p>

                <p>The entire process, from start to finish, generally takes less than an hour
                    and requires no downtime—allowing clients to return to their daily activities immediately.</p>

                <p>The Spectra laser has a multitude of uses from tattoo removal to reducing the appearance of irregularities in the skin. Fortunately, it also helps to reduce the appearance of acne and any acne-related scarring.</p>
